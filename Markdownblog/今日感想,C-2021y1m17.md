# C pointer and array

## some confusion

we all know that an array can store a specific number of the specific type of data.And it can be called in the following syntax.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int aa[2] = {1,2};
void main(void){
    printf("%d",aa[1]);
}
----------------
output:2
```

However,for once,I have happended to declared a variable and initialized it with a pointer to array,and I finded that the memory address of the array was the same as that of the first int of the array. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
int (*apoint)[6];
int *intpoint;

void main(void){
    apoint = &array;
    intpoint = &(array[0]);
    printf("%d\n",apoint);
    printf("%d",intpoint);
}
----------------
output:4206600
       4206600
```

## The search for answer

After learning of this surprising phenomenon,I have had an idea-whether I can decompose the syntaxes of the using arrays into some piece of syntaxes which can be used not only in arrays manipulating but also on a larger scale. So I began to look for some articles about array and pointer.

Hard work pays off,I finded a term--decay(array to pointer decay),which means the variable of array will decay into a pointer to the first item of the array,and that's why the above phenomenon is present.

## Conclusion

1. var1[var2] /\*var1 is a memory address*/is an operator which means var1+= var2;

2. the variable of an array actually is not a array,which indicates that we can create an array with pointer ourselves.Maybe Array is juat a syntactic sugar(lmao).

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int aaa = 1;
int *aapoi;

void main(void){
    aapoi = &aaa;
    aapoi++;
    *aapoi = 2;
    aapoi++;
    *aapoi = 3;
    aapoi++;
    *aapoi = 4;
    printf("%d\n",(&aaa)[1]);
}
------------------
output:2
```
